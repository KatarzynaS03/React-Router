# React-Router
The application was created as part of completing the list 10 from the subject of Network Technologies - biomedical engineering, year III.


The goal was to create a simple React app that would display the Wimbledon Winners' Leaderboard broken down by female and male. You will get the data using the wimbledon-champions library. The data was loaded into the main page of the application (MainPage, not an App component) using the Effect Hook. At the top of the page there is a bar (Navbar) that redirects to the main window.
In the main window, there are buttons redirecting to (one) component rendering the selected list (women / men). This component displays the consisting table
from the three columns: full name, tournament victories year (s) and total number of victories.
MUI was used to stylize the application - add elements related to the tournament, e.g. logo.
